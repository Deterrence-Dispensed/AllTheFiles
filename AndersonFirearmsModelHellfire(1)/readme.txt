Thanks for getting the Anderson Firearms Model 5.56 Hellfire. To get started, open the file "INSTRUCTIONS_MANUAL.pdf"

To get started on printing, look into the "STL_FILES" Folder and print files numbered from 1-8. Make sure to read the manual first to see
how many parts you need to print, as some parts will need more than one to accomplish the assembly. To print, open your preferred slicer,
than load the parts onto the print bed. It is recommended to print one part at a time, however many members of the beta have shown that it
is possible to print everything onto a 20x20x22(cm) bed of an Ender 3 printer.

VERSION: 1.0.0

Updates as of December 3, 2020:
	
	- The Beta is essentially complete, all the main components of the design have been accomplish as is: it works exactly as intended.
	- The only updates from here on out will be to modify it's aesthetics. To be frank, I dont want to change it: I like it the way it is.
	- I will move on to the Bloodfire (LR DPMS 308 or what most folks will call the "AR-10" lower) and the TinderFire
	- Started a MAGA initiative (Make American Guns Again) aimed at getting the the United States to becoming the forefront leaders of the
	  3d printed gun innovation. Texas WILL be the leading forefront into this frontier, and will continue to be, until the end of this
	  State's great Republic
	- Started the KAGA initiative (Keep American Guns Again) aimed at combating current efforts to disarm Americans against threats foriegn
	  (California) and domestic (Austin).
	- Future plans will include the DEMONFIRE, an attempt to completely replace everything on the AR except the upper reciever. This means
	  3d printed lower parts kit, buffertube, pistol grip, stock, even iron sights. Needless to say this idea is a bit insane but I have
	  ideas on how this could work. If successful, It may change the name of the game forever. Hopefully. Anyways, what are you reading
	  this for? Go fucking print some guns.
